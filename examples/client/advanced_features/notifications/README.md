| Next Example | Complexity | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| **Pairing** | 5/10 | Multi-device synchronization |
| **Production Patterns** | 6/10 | Real-world storage patterns |
| **Integration** | 7/10 | Multi-component workflows |

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Go 1.19 or later
- Self SDK dependencies (handled by go.mod)
- Basic understanding of event-driven programming
- Completion of simple_chat and group_chat examples
- Understanding of storage example (recommended)

## 💡 Troubleshooting

**Notification Issues:**
- Ensure notification handlers are set up before sending
- Check network connectivity for notification delivery
- Verify target DIDs are valid and reachable

**Event Handling Issues:**
- Confirm event handlers are properly configured
- Check callback function implementations
- Verify event handler registration timing

**Build Issues:**
- Run `go mod tidy` to ensure dependencies
- Check Go version with `go version`
- Verify you're in the correct directory

## 🔔 Notification Architecture

### Notification Flow
```
Application → Self SDK → Notification System → Target Device
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
Event Handler ← Delivery Status ← Network ← User Response
```

### Event Types
- **Sent**: Notification was sent from your application
- **Delivered**: Notification reached the target device
- **Response**: User interacted with the notification
- **Failed**: Notification delivery failed

This example provides the foundation for real-time user engagement in Self SDK applications! 🔔
