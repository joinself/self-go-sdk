- Timestamps establish validity periods

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Profile Credential with Multiple Claims
**Multi-claim concepts:**
- Adding multiple claims to a single credential
- Different data types in claims
- Organizing related information
- Building upon basic concepts

**Key Learning Points:**
- Multiple related claims can be grouped in one credential
- Claims can contain different data types (strings, booleans, dates)
- Grouping related information improves efficiency
- Each claim is cryptographically protected

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Credential with Evidence
**Advanced features:**
- Creating custom credential types

- Evidence provides additional verification material
- Asset management handles secure file storage
- Presentations package credentials for sharing
- Hash references link credentials to evidence

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Organization Credential with Complex Claims
**Complex data structures:**
- Complex nested objects in claims
- Arrays and collections in credentials
- Hierarchical data organization
- Real-world organizational data modeling
- Advanced claim structuring techniques

**Key Learning Points:**
- Credentials can contain complex nested data structures
- Arrays enable multiple values for single claim types
- Hierarchical organization mirrors real-world data
- Complex claims maintain cryptographic integrity
- Structured data enables precise verification queries
