## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. Go 1.19 or later
2. Self SDK dependencies (automatically handled by go.mod)

### Running the Examples

Each example is a standalone Go program. Run them in order:

```bash
# 1. Basic Exchange (start here)
cd basic && go run main.go

# 2. Multi-Credential Exchange
cd ../multi && go run main.go

# 3. Advanced Exchange
cd ../advanced && go run main.go

# 4. Discovery Exchange
cd ../discovery && go run main.go

# Or run the simplified version in the root directory
cd .. && go run main.go
```

### 🔧 Build Requirements

Each subdirectory is a standalone Go module with its own `go.mod` file. The examples use a local replace directive to reference the Self SDK, so they should build and run without any additional setup.

### What Each Example Does

All examples create two clients (issuer and holder) and demonstrate different aspects of credential exchange:

- **Issuer**: Creates and signs credentials, requests credentials from holders
- **Holder**: Receives credentials, responds to credential requests
- **Exchange**: The interactive process of requesting and sharing credentials

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After completing all examples, you'll understand:

### Core Concepts
- ✅ How credential exchange works between parties

- `WaitForResponse()` - Wait for peer connections
- Peer-to-peer credential exchange

## 🛠️ Customization

Each example can be customized for your specific use case:

### Credential Types
- Modify credential types to match your domain
- Add custom claims relevant to your application
- Implement domain-specific validation logic

### Exchange Patterns
- Customize request/response handlers
- Implement business logic for credential validation
- Add audit logging and compliance tracking

### Discovery Integration
- Integrate with existing identity systems
- Customize QR code generation and display
- Implement custom peer discovery mechanisms

## 📚 Next Steps

After completing these examples:

1. **🎓 Explore credential issuance** in `../credential_issuance/` - Learn how to create the credentials you're exchanging
2. **📖 Review the Self SDK documentation** for advanced features
3. **🏗️ Build your own credential exchange application**
4. **🔗 Integrate with existing identity management systems**
5. **🎯 Combine issuance and exchange** - Create end-to-end credential workflows

### 🔄 Credential Lifecycle

Understanding the complete credential lifecycle:
- **Issuance** (`../credential_issuance/`) - Creating and signing credentials
- **Exchange** (this tutorial) - Requesting and sharing credentials  
- **Verification** - Validating credential authenticity and claims
- **Revocation** - Managing credential lifecycle and updates
