# Self SDK Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating the Self SDK's capabilities across different use cases and complexity levels.

## 📁 Example Categories

### 🎯 [Client Examples](client/) - **Recommended Starting Point**
Modern, educational examples with progressive complexity:

- **[Credential Issuance](client/credential_issuance/)** - Create and sign verifiable credentials
- **[Credential Exchange](client/credentials_exchange/)** - Request and share credentials  
- **[Simple Chat](client/simple_chat/)** - Basic secure messaging
- **[Group Chat](client/group_chat/)** - Multi-party communication
- **[Discovery Subscription](client/discovery_subscription/)** - Peer discovery
- **[Advanced Features](client/advanced_features/)** - Production patterns

### 🔧 Legacy Examples
These examples demonstrate specific SDK features but may be less educational:

- **[Chat](chat/)** - Basic messaging implementation
- **[Agreement](agreement/)** - Agreement protocols
- **[Discovery](discovery/)** - Peer discovery mechanisms
- **[Credentials](credentials/)** - Credential operations
- **[Utils](utils/)** - Utility functions and helpers

## 🚀 Quick Start
